# text2imag_genai_decor
Repo for image captioning and generating images from texts using a fine-tuned stable diffuser
Create a virtual environment, and install all the requirements for requirements.txt
run the app.py file for text to image use cases
OR
run the app_bkp.py file for both text to image and image to image use cases
The image generation is faster with GPU support, if not it usually takes a few minutes.
